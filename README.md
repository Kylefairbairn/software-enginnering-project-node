This repo was a project completed by myself along with three other other partners. This assignment was our final project for our software enginnering 
class.We were tasked to complete a new feature given some legacy code. The application itself is a clone of a similar social media application "twitter".
Our new feature was implementing a group chat feature. Out stack was using the MERN and our database was using MongoDB
